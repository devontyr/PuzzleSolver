User Guide:
When the user opens the application for the first time, they are met with only one option which is to **Open Image** of their choosing. 
The user will then ideally choose a scan of puzzle pieces.  The user has the option to open as many additional images as they want, using the now enabled **Add Image** button. These additional images would ideally be scans of puzzle pieces that all belong to the same puzzle as the original opened image.
At any point after the first image is opened, the user is free to use the **Process** button. This button is to be used after all puzzle piece scans have been added. When clicked, our algorithm is run on all of the images, which opens a new QGraphicsView with each puzzle piece as a separate element, free to move around and rotate independently of all the other pieces.
